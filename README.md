# Frontend Repository for AD Group Assignment Test

For AD Group frontend assignment test.

I use nextjs which is ReactJs framework as client-side, that bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## how to

### Git clone it to your local directory

```
$ git clone https://github.com/fransyosuaa/ad_group_frontend.git
```

### Go to the folder, and install the dependencies

```
$ cd ad_group_frontend
$ npm i
```

### Run it

```
$ npm run start
```

## User type

In this system, I create two user-type, `user` and `admin`.

The difference between them, `user` only can see his/her only activity log, meanwhile for `admin` can see all users (also has filter feature)

For `admin`,

```
email : admin@gmail.com
password : p@ssw0rdsss
```
